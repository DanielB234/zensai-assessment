Given an hour long time limit, this was as much of the project as I could do, 
obviously functionality and style leaves a lot to be desired, but its not too difficult a project

I borrowed the basic template for fluentui to build the bones, and built on top of it a working add button, which opens a dialog box to add todo's,
which will display them in a list format

To run the project, just make sure npm is installed and run `npm start`,
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
